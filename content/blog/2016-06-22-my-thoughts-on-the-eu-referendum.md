This referendum has tested my passion for politics. It has been crass, bitter and based on lies; mostly from the leave campaign. I don’t believe that there is one ‘right’ answer. There are valid arguments for both sides; and the debate would have been stronger if everyone had just admitted that.

However there is one crutch that I think has propped up the leave campaign’s momentum from the start and that is the thin veil of immigration concerns, which I believe masks nothing short of xenophobia.

A guy called Laurence Taylor echoed my feelings exactly with a [full-page ad](http://metro.co.uk/2016/06/22/who-is-laurence-taylor-guy-with-eu-referendum-ad-in-metro-explains-why-he-did-it-5959925/) that he took out in today’s Metro. “Why can’t we cope with a 0.5%/yr rise in population?” he writes; which is what 330,000 net from the EU comprises.

He’s raising two important issues here:
1. The ’76 million Turks’ scaremongering and Farage’s near-as-makes-no-difference fascist poster are inaccurate  and borne out of racism. Even with recent crises in population movements, anyone with any logic should throw these arguments out. However it feels like this is buoying most the leave share; which raises serious concerns about our society. I mean, someone actually got murdered over their vocal disregard for this xenophobic idiot herding whistle test.
2. If the concern is that more people means more stress on public services, then we have to look no further than a Conservative government that has slashed budgets despite existing growing pressures. Leaving the EU gives PM-elect BoJo and Michael FUCKING Gove another reason to choke departments and local government.

Vote however you want. I think there are some valid reasons why Britain could benefit from leaving the EU. However it feels like many leave votes are propped up by my first point above, which makes me feel physically sick.

I am a generation Y citizen of the world. I have no more or less in common with someone in Bucharest or Sunderland. Whether certain decisions are made by a stranger in Westminster or a stranger in Brussels is not as important to me as living in a society that isn’t divisive, insular and quick to forget the millions that died just 70 years ago for peace in Europe.
