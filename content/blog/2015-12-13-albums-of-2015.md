I don't tend to obsess about 'albums of the year' lists as much as some, but I recently put together a list of my favourite records of 2015 for a music community, so I thought it worthwhile to share the list here.

2. Everything Everything - Get To Heaven
3. Unknown Mortal Orchestra - Multi Love
4. Deerhunter - Fading Frontier
5. Tobias Jesso Jr. - Goon
6. Viet Cong - Viet Cong
7. Tame Impala - Currents
8. Braids - Deep In The Iris
9. Father John Misty - I Love You, Honeybear
10. Action Bronson - Mr. Wonderful
11. Kurt Vile - b'lieve i'm goin down...
12. Bersarin Quartet - III
13. Laura Marling - Short Movie
14. Blur - The Magic Whip

I also keep a running annual Spotify playlist that has a collection of tracks that I've been listening to this year, regardless of the year they were recorded:
