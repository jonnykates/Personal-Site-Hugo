It feels like I'm on the cusp of a few major life changes. Next year, I'll be getting married; moving house; and turning 30 - all possibly within a month of each other. In an attempt to minimise the risk of any potential mental breakdown, I've decided to make some changes in my professional life today to put me in a better position to make these significant life changes (namely moving house) tomorrow.

I've recently started working on a freelance basis as a designer and frontend developer for an organisation called [Raising IT](http://www.raisingit.com/). The work is mostly remote, meaning that Natalie and I can look at getting on the property ladder somewhere that isn't the south east of England.

I first became aware of Raising IT some years ago whilst working at [ClearlySo](https://www.clearlyso.com/) and have followed their progress ever since. They have developed a website platform and CMS that is specifically tailored to the needs of non-profits. Features such as fundraising and social media integration are part of the platform out of the box.

Where Raising IT really provide value though, is in the work they do with clients on their online strategy. Before any designs or any code is touched, clients complete a two day strategy workshop to hash out all of the many suggestions and ideas that are an inevitable part of any purpose driven organisation with numerous stakeholders. Before I sit with the client in a design capacity, these brainstorm discussions have already been tackled meaning that a lot of the heavy lifting in terms of defining the direction of the website have been nailed.

As someone who often works on projects from cover to cover in a project management capacity, this process is great from a designer's perspective as it means the design process can be incredibly focused over a relatively short sprint. Two weeks in fact - from kicking off the design to having a fully signed off, built, and tested site template into which the client can populate their content. If you don't distract designers from the design, they can produce results incredibly fast. Other efficiencies are baked into the development process as well - such as a starting SCSS framework that has been specifically tailored to Raising IT's platform.

It's also great to be working with some clients who are doing incredible things; which is something I have missed in the past couple of years. I'm looking forward to getting stuck into a new challenge and edging closer to full-time freelance work (if you hate your current website, hit me up!). Here's to a busy 12 months.
