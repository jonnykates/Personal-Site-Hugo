What a week. A week ago, the country was still digesting the game-changing news that Britain's electorate had voted to leave the European Union. Since then, somewhere inbetween 'the most things ever' and 'not enough' has happened in UK politics.

Of course one of the things that *should* have happened in the intervening week is that the Labour party should have rung the Tories out to dry. David Cameron used the promise/threat of an EU referendum to postpone his own party's capitulation, only to have this backfire beyond repair at the expense of everyone in this country and beyond.

But that's not what happened. Instead, a large number of Labour MPs plotted - many weeks ago - to use this small window of opportunity whilst the belly of the beast was exposed to attempt a Caesar style assassination of their own leader. And so at this week's PMQs, Jeremy Corbyn had to publicly tell off his *own* backbenchers whilst soon-to-be-retired Cameron, who is directly responsible for this mess, was able to point the finger at Corbyn and demand that he jump.

I've seen plenty within the left commentary columns and blogs this week that dismantle the Labour coup, but I've been surprised with the propensity that the mainstream media has propped up its legitimacy.

**Regardless** of what you think of Corbyn's politics or of the man as a leader; there are serious democratic questions to be asked of the PLP's actions in the past week (and their behind-doors plotting months before that). Jeremy Corbyn won a *60%* share of the membership vote only 9 months ago and since then, his standing amongst the membership has grown significantly. In the very same membership vote, Angela Eagle placed *fourth* for the Deputy Leader position.

So, even if it were democratic, can we really conclude that Eagle is more electable than Corbyn? Does offering up Eagle as a 'unity candidate' make any sense in the slightest? Well the answer ultimately depends on the question itself. What exactly, and according to whom, does democratic leadership of the Labour party look like right now? As far as I see it, the Labour party is being pulled - perhaps irrepressibly - in **three** separate directions.

The Labour membership voted for JC and has quietly broken membership growth records since his candidacy was announced. <!-- Since Milliband introduced the Â£3-opt-in vote at the last count, the pool of people who were able to actually influence the direction of the party was widened significantly. Many feel this has been disastrous, yet for many (120k+); this was just the vehicle to finally allow someone who represented their personal politics to the fore. --> This is legitimacy according to the gospel of the membership; and if Corbyn is on another ballot then he will inevitably be elected leader again. Corbyn's continual membership support cannot be quashed by infighting. He will not resign. I am currently very anxious that this impasse will split the Labour party.

Then you have the parliamentary Labour party, who appear more than anything to simply not like Jeremy Corbyn regardless of what the membership say. Now, this isn't necessarily a bad thing; although it flirts very, very, closely with the perminter of democracy and the media have been quick to prop it up. But what the PLP are currently saying is that after 9 months of trying as hard as they can, the people who work closely with Corbyn every single day simply don't think that he has what it takes to win a general election. And as a Corbyn sympathiser, I am perfectly willing to listen and believe them. I had a lump in my throat when I watched [Angela's tears and passion](https://youtu.be/lgQjhj1BCY4?t=3m45s) for Labour and have no doubt of her sincerity (if not her credentials). It is frankly not fair or right for the membership to dismiss the PLP's concerns with such blind gusto as we have seen from some. Again, blindness from the other side of the fence will cause the Labour party to split.

Then last but not least, you have the actual *labour* whom the Labour party are supposed to represent at parliament; working class everyday-folk. This group are obviously numerically much larger and more important than the membership base and are the whole point of the Labour movement. Yet the public have been hugely forgotten in the furore. If we don't win the General Election in 4+ years then we are not fulfilling our promise to the most vulnerable. And Labour certainly aren't going to win whilst at civil war.

It's really sad, but I cannot see a way out of this impasse that doesn't result in an A.K.A. 'Socialist Democrats Party' and 'New Labour' split of the party. Yet whilst there's still hope, both sides should listen to each other and think primarily of the movement.
