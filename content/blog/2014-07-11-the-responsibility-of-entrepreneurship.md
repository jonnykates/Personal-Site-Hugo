Imagine one morning you get a phone call from a market research call centre. It’s a Monday and you’ve just put the kettle on, so you indulge the caller and agree to answer a quick survey. Expecting to be asked about your electricity service provider or possibly a recent purchase you made online, you’re taken aback when the caller asks bluntly, ‘On a scale of one to ten, how would you rate the state of the world today?’

How would you respond? There’s no denying that the problems facing our world today remain huge and urgent. They call for disruptive and decisive solutions – something that as of yet we’ve apparently been unable to crack. These problems have foiled governments, charities and philanthropists for decades. But what role can business play in righting the wrongs in society?

I’ve always been a big fan of the capabilities approach to development; first pioneered by the economist Amartya Sen in the 80’s. Sen suggested that a person’s well-being is intrinsically linked to what they are able to do. Money has traditionally been seen as the key component in enabling people but this represents a fallible (and generally westernised) approach. We’ve tried throwing money at our problems and they don’t go away.

This is why I’m excited by the growing potential of innovation to tackle society’s problems. At [ClearlySo](http://www.clearlyso.com), we meet entrepreneurs on a daily basis who are using their business skills to create a positive social and/or environmental impact. They don’t rely on good will and donations – they sell products and services to a market as any other private company would. This is beyond the concept of corporate social responsibility; these are private companies whose core mission is to make a positive difference as a direct result of their operations.

We live in an ever shrinking and inter-connected world, not least due to the internet. This has done two dramatic things. Firstly, it has made the access to information and education much easier – that’s a huge capability right there. Secondly, it has meant that innovators can share, influence, learn from and ultimately help those that aren’t geographically proximate to themselves. Many of the companies we work with are based in London but their direct impact is felt thousands of miles away, helping the world’s most disadvantaged.

Take [Peepoople](http://www.peepoople.com/) for example, who operate in the slums of Kenya and Bangladesh turning human waste in to fertilizer – hardly a glamorous business but one which has huge impact. Single-use biodegradable toilets (known as ‘Peepoos’) are sold by female micro-entrepreneurs to citizens of the slum who then drop their deposits at a local collection points in exchange for a refund. The collected waste is then transported to a storage area where it is transformed in to useable fertiliser, which can then be sold back to the community.

The women who sell the Peepoos receive business training as well as tuition on how to promote hygiene to the customers they meet. Aside from providing a valuable fertiliser to a subsistent community, Peepoople are also tackling a larger issue of water contamination in some of the poorest slums on the planet.

And the growth rate of social enterprises, at least from what we see in the UK, is staggering. ClearlySo helps social entrepreneurs to raise equity investments of at least £300k, and we are inundated with businesses to work with.

You would be forgiven for offering the market researcher cold-caller a fairly modest score in response to their question ‘how would you rate the state of the world today?’ But when asked where we’ll be in 100 years, the most stringent pessimist within me can’t help but believe social enterprises will have played a substantial role in raising the score.
