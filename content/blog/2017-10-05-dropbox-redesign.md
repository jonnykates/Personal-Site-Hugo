Yesterday, Dropbox shared their [new branding](http://dropbox.design) with the world; including a new logo, colour palette, illustration style, typography - essentially a complete overhaul of the Dropbox brand. The new identity takes the organisation in a wildly new direction and has caused [quite a stir amongst the design community](https://dribbble.com/shots/3849043-Dropbox-Rebrand). You can take a look [here](http://dropbox.design).

Dropbox have established themselves as a household name over more than a decade as one of the leading cloud file storage services. My mum uses Dropbox. So we have to ask _why_ Dropbox felt the need to rebrand themselves in such an extreme manner at this stage in their development, with such an established and diverse user base.

To me, the rebrand suggests that Dropbox wants to move away from being perceived as a business focused utility. But can a leopard change its spots? Shifting the identity in such an extreme matter isn't going to change how users actually use the app. At it's core, Dropbox *is* a utility designed to do one fairly boring thing. The new brand doesn't really sit well with the service's purpose or user base.

Also what struck me yesterday whilst I was browsing through Dropbox's big design reveal was how little I had previously touched any of Dropbox's corporate identity in comparison to the amount that I actually use the service. I tend to just sync my Dropbox folders to my computers using the native file system, which obviously uses the core UI of the operating system. Very occasionally I find myself having to fetch a file from the cloud using the web app - usually from a folder that I don't have selectively synced - which got me wondering how Dropbox are going to roll out this new identity into their web app.

This mockup may be a little crude, but if Dropbox push their new hugely experimental identity into what essentially is a file system then this is perhaps the sort of thing that my mum will be faced with when she next opens up Dropbox in her browser. Is that _really_ necessary? Also, think again about the juxtaposition between the web app and the native Windows and Mac syncing app. Dropbox are departing from a clean, easy to use UI that matches somewhat the look and feel of an operating system's file browser into an unexplored experimental UI that may make some users think there's something wrong with their computer.

I love the new logo glyph and I admire Dropbox's bravery in this new approach but I can't help think that it's experimental for the sake of it and doesn't reflect what Dropbox is as a service. Also, the colour scheme is too brutalistic to my eye for the sake of pushing boundaries and the typeface Sharp Grotesk is disgusting. It also comes with 259 fonts - so good luck establishing consistency across a huge organisation.
