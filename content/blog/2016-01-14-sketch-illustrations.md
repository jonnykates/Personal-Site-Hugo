Perhaps I'm a little late to the [Sketch](https://www.sketchapp.com/) party, but I started experimenting with designing website interfaces in Sketch a few months ago. I've now made the complete transition - I literally uninstalled Photoshop over the Christmas break.

Last night, I found myself experimenting with illustration in Sketch whilst watching TV and, well, ended up drawing my TV. The result is below (in SVG format; horray for vectors!).
