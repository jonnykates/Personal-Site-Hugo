One weekend recently, I built a small AngularJS project that offers short, Twitter-length summaries of the back-and-forth exchanges at the weekly Prime Minister's Questions sessions in the House of Commons. I dubbed it 'Quick PMQs', and you can check it out [here](http://www.quickpmqs.co.uk).

The exercise was mostly for my own benefit, so that I could get more familiar with Angular. But I do think that in someways it raises an interesting point. Debates in the House of Commons are often conducted over a backdrop of jeering, heckling and generally antagonistic behaviour. Also, the course of the debates themselves often descends into what can only be described as a personal slagging match.

To be fair to Jeremy Corbyn, the Labour leader has tried to reset the PMQ debate; not least by inviting the public to send him questions to be put to the Prime Minister. Despite his best interests, this has had limited success - as seen in [this video](https://www.facebook.com/cloakedtruth/videos/512311918942511/?pnref=story).

Hopefully [Quick PMQs](http://www.quickpmqs.co.uk) can offer a brief digest of the key points at the weekly debate between JC and David Cameron.
