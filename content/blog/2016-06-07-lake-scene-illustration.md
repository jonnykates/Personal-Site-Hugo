[![Lake scene](/img/iso-lake-scene.png)](/img/iso-lake-scene.png)

I took a well needed break from work last week, and whilst I wasn't able to totally disconnect myself from technology, I did spend some valuable (and hot!) quiet time in rural Devon.

I really like isometric technical drawings so I wanted to work on something that had this kind of perspective.
