I'm a designer and frontend web developer based in St. Albans, UK. I help organisations to improve their internet game and I can help you too.

I didnâ€™t always work with the web. I studied Human Geography at university, learning about social and economic development in sub-Saharan Africa. I then worked for a company called [ClearlySo](http://www.clearlyso.com), helping entrepreneurs who run innovative businesses that benefit society.

These days, I enjoy the challenge of working on all sorts of web projects as a freelancer. I love helping clients with those early challenging conversations right at the start of a project, right through to designing user interfaces that are beautiful and easy to use.

Websites can be complicated and sometimes it can be difficult to know where to even begin; yet your website is the public shop-front to your organisation so there's often a lot of pressure on getting it right. If that sounds familiar to your situation, I'd love to hear more about it and have a conversation about how I might be able to help you. I like to think that my services are great value and I'm sure that we'd enjoy working together.

I am also a keen musician in my spare time. You can hear some of my music on [Bandcamp](http://jonnykates.bandcamp.com/) or follow me on [Soundcloud](https://soundcloud.com/jonny-kates).
